## No-arbitrage

Derivatives are priced using the no-arbitrage or arbitrage-free principle: the price of the derivative is set at the same level as the value of the replicating portfolio, 
so that no trader can __make a risk-free profit by buying one and selling the other__.


If any arbitrage opportunities do arise, they quickly disappear as traders taking advantage of the arbitrage push the derivative’s price until it equals the value of replicating portfolios.

## Risk-neutral
This is heavily used in the pricing of financial derivatives due to the fundamental theorem of asset pricing, which implies that in a complete market, a derivative's price is the discounted expected value of the future payoff under the unique risk-neutral measure.[1] Such a measure exists if and only if the market is arbitrage-free.
