## No-arbitrage

Derivatives are priced using the no-arbitrage or arbitrage-free principle: the price of the derivative is set at the same level as the value of the replicating portfolio, 
so that no trader can __make a risk-free profit by buying one and selling the other__.

利用一组金融资产来复制另一组金融资产的未来现金流，当两种不同的资产组合未来损益（payoff）相同时，则它们之间应该实现头寸(position)上的完全对冲

e.g. options payoff = stocks payoff


If any arbitrage opportunities do arise, they quickly disappear as traders taking advantage of the arbitrage push the derivative’s price until it equals the value of replicating portfolios.

## Risk-neutral
This is heavily used in the pricing of financial derivatives due to the fundamental theorem of asset pricing, which implies that in a complete market, a derivative's price is the discounted expected value of the future payoff under the unique risk-neutral measure.[1] Such a measure exists if and only if the market is arbitrage-free.

For example, a risk-neutral investor will be indifferent between receiving $100 for sure, or playing a lottery that gives her a 50 percent chance of winning $200 and a 50 percent chance of getting nothing. Both alternatives have the same expected value; the lottery, however, is riskier.

Risk-neutral valuation. Risk-neutral valuation says that when valuing derivatives like stock options, you can simplify by assuming that all assets grow—and can be discounted—at the risk-free rate. In fact, this is a key component that can be used for valuation, as Black, Scholes, and Merton proved in their Nobel Prize-winning formula.

A method for valuing financial assets. Risk-neutral valuation calculates the value of an asset by discounting the expected value of its future pay-offs at the risk-free rate of return. The expected value is not obtained using the actual probabilities of each pay-off. Instead, risk-neutral valuation calculates the expected value of future pay-offs using constructed probabilities that have the property of rationalizing observed asset prices if all investors were risk-neutral.

At any point, investors can either (a) hold $1 stock or (b)invest $1 at the risk-free rate r.
A risk-neutral investor would not care which portfolio they owned if they had the same return.
