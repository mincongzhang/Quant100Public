## No-arbitrage

Derivatives are priced using the no-arbitrage or arbitrage-free principle: the price of the derivative is set at the same level as the value of the replicating portfolio, 
so that no trader can __make a risk-free profit by buying one and selling the other__.


If any arbitrage opportunities do arise, they quickly disappear as traders taking advantage of the arbitrage push the derivativeâ€™s price until it equals the value of replicating portfolios.
